The OBi2182 is a discontinued SIP hardphone manufactured by Obihai (who were acquired by Poly, formerly Polycom). They were "top of the line" in 2017 and 2018, and have a number of cool features, including but not limited to both ethernet and wifi connectivity, support for Google Voice, and the ability to serve as a handset via Bluetooth for a cell phone. Resellers are reselling them for ~60 USD online.

After finally setting up VoIP on my [SDF](https://sdf.org/) account, getting it setup was a relative breeze. You can do it through the online [OBitalk customer portal](https://www.obitalk.com/), but of course, that requires you to set up another account. The OBi2182 also comes with a built in webserver that provides you with the ability to get into the administrative user interface.

This is a quick reference for the settings if you don't want to use OBitalk. It only includes changes where things are not the default value provided bythe OBi2182. Note: *ITSP Profile `X`* just refers to one of the ITSP Profile option groups (`[A..F]`]), and *SP`N` Service* refers to `SP[1..6] Service`. For an exhaustive desription of the configuration options, consult the *[Obihai IP Phone Administration Guide](https://www.obitalk.com/info/documents/admin_guide/OBiPhoneAdminGuide.pdf)* ([archived link](http://web.archive.org/web/20220122012424/https://www.obitalk.com/info/documents/admin_guide/OBiPhoneAdminGuide.pdf)). Consult the fine [SDF tutorial](https://wiki.sdf.org/doku.php?id=setting_up_a_sip_phone_with_sdf_voip) for general information about setting up a SIP phone with SDF VoIP.
