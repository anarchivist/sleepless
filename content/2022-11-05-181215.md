I've printed a couple of projects using risography (small zines and a record sleeve/poster), and I've come to love the process. This is really just a link dump until I figure out what else to with this page.

## Shops and studios in Seattle

* [Paper Press Punch](https://www.paperpresspunch.com/) in Georgetown is the place I've worked with. They're great, run open studios (once you've been trained), and are very supportive of the local scene. Their site has a lot of [great info](https://www.paperpresspunch.com/riso-printing) on process and they have a pretty good [range of colors](https://www.paperpresspunch.com/print-services).
* [Cold Cube Press](https://www.coldcubepress.com/) is studio that can take jobs for hire. 
* [Anemone Studio](https://anemone.studio/) is a studio, not a for-hire shop. They developed [Spectrolite](https://anemone.studio/spectrolite), which is a Mac app that helps with color separation, halftoning, etc. (which means you don't need to fuck with Adobe in the same way).
* [Zine Hug](https://zinehug.com/) is a studio/micropress, also not set up to print for-hire.
* [Really Easy Press](https://www.reallyeasy.press/) is a studio/publisher for comics and illustration zines; no jobs for hire. 

## Resources 

* [Riso Pop](https://risopop.com/) has a good, [basic tutorial](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d665d7207aca80001560a23/t/5eb4095656fa2a6cdf0c1154/1588857186583/risohandout_full.pdf) that explains the process.
* [Risotto](https://risottostudio.com/) has their own [tutorials](https://risottostudio.com/pages/tutorials) for digital process.
* CCS in Detroit has probably the [most comprehensive guide](https://campus.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/imaging-center/imaging-center-services/risograph-printing-riso-mf4950/) I've found, with other things like color swatches! Lots of good [video tutorials](https://campus.collegeforcreativestudies.edu/imaging-center/main/video-tutorials-winter-2021/risograph-tutorials/), too;
* Paper Press Punch's Zine of the Month Club Portal has good info on [color separations](https://www.paperpresspunch.com/zine-portal-color-separations) for both physical originals and digital files
* [STENCIL](https://www.stencil.wiki/) is the Riso wiki. I've mostly just used the [Riso Ink Colors](https://www.stencil.wiki/colors) page.
